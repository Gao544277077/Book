# Book

This program is create a book store.I have uses mongodb to create a database called book
 and details of book has three variables: "barcode, name and price". The program is uses mongodb 
 and PUG to CRUD book details on the webpage. After then,I have create a database called 'user' and I also
 have uses Passport config to build a registraction system with 'user' database, And then,I create third 
 database called order, it is uses to build a shooping cart page. In the book detail page, I have create
 a button called add-cart that application will move book's detail to the order page that means I will get 
 the books detail in the shooping cart. Finally, I have uses paypal to make a transaction system, it is 
 support to make a payment of shooping cart.
